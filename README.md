# Image and Audio Generation and Editing using Python
The GitHub repository for the Python branch of my independent study in Image and audio generation and editing using code, [IN6010IS].

This repository contains the Python work product of an independent study conducted at College of the Atlantic, Bar Harbor,
ME, in Fall 2021. In this independent study, I explored digital media generation, editing, and manipulation with code, and
developped a set of simple tools using libraries for digital media reading and analysis, and data manipulation, to play 
around with media files. These tools form the package `media_tools` which is stored in the media_tools folder of this repository. 

The `media_tools` package is a foundation from which development can build upon to expand the possibilities for media mischief 
in Python. The package provides a hopefully useful base with room for subsequent development and expansion.

Please consult the `requirements.txt` document for a complete list of the libraries used in this project. 

The media tools package, at present, contains 4 modules:
- `image_tools`, designed to work with image files and data.
- `audio_tools`, designed to work with audio files and data.
- `video_tools`, designed to work with video files and data.
- `data_tools`, designed to provide general purpose data manipulation capabilities when working with data arrays.

My full independent study proposal is available to read [here](project_documentation/Fall%202021%20Independent%20Study%20Proposal%20Phileas.pdf),
and more contextual information about the project and this repository specifically can be found [here](project_documentation/General_Independent_Study_Notebook.ipynb).

If you are coming across this project and thinking of trying media_tools out, I hope you enjoy the experience! Pull requests
are quite welcome!
