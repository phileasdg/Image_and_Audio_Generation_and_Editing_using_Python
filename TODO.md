# TODO:
- get audio reading from video files
- display video in Jupyter notebook
- Send Colin the GitHub repository
- Brainstorm effects ideas
- Consider desctructive vs non desctructive effects, and different levels of destructiveness
- Consider additive non-destructive effect, normalised data in, normalised data out.
- destructive effects typically applied last, but consider wacky effects of **not** doing that.
