# TODO:
- Brainstorm effects ideas
  - datamoshing and databending
  - direct mapping
  - generating stuff using strange attractors
  - pixel sorting
  - colour and form effects
  - introducing analogueness into the digital
  
- Consider desctructive vs non desctructive effects, and different levels of destructiveness
- Consider additive non-destructive effect, normalised data in, normalised data out.
- destructive effects typically applied last, but consider wacky effects of **not** doing that.

**Get two to three effects examples working to show Colin by next Thursday.**

1. for i in range(n) apply effects to data and save it as image and audio
2. for i in range(number of images/audio files) combine images into an animation,
and combine audio files into one audio file such that the new file is the same length
as the original audio file (merging or splitting/splicing/connecting data).
3. save the result as a video with audio
